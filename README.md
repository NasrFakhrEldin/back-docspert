## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Book App locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   - It's a good practice to isolate your project dependencies in a virtual environment.

   - Create a new virtual environment:

     ```
     python -m venv .venv
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

       ```
       source .venv/Scripts/activate
       ```


4. **Install project dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Apply database migrations:**

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
